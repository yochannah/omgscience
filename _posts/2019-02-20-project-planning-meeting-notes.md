**Present:** Caroline + Carole + Gos + Me

First project planning meeting. I shared my plans for the first project - looking at the usability of the InterMine Cloud Wizard, and talked about plans to assess its usability. Turns out I was thinking too big, and I need to think of much smaller chunks, and stop thinking so much like a software engineer - more theory, less implementation focus.

Some possible chunks:

- Reviewing usability of other bioinformatics tools (Possible: Galaxy, InterMine, Molgenis, Biothings)
- [uxls](https://uxls.org) toolkit applied in practice
   - work with users who know intermine
   - also users who do not.

Things to think about & learn:  
 - What is good wizardry practice?  
 - Work with E regarding literature.  

Interesting / relevant conferences:  
 - [CHI](https://chi2019.acm.org/)  
 - [CSCW](http://cscw.acm.org/2019/)  

And always think - "so what?".

Expanding into a longer set of thoughts:  
 - Why did you do x? Define questions more clearly.  
 - Why does it matter?  
 - How can we measure it?  
 - What knowledge do I gain that others can re-use?
