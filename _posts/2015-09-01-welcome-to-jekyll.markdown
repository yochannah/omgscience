So, I keep on getting excited about my work at Cambridge University's Department of Genetics. I'm most not a scientist - I'm a software developer, with a focus on front end web stuff - but my workplace totally is sciencey. My team makes [Intermine](http://intermine.org), designed to support biologists in data exploration and discovery.

The thing that keeps on blowing my mind is that science is done right around me all the time. Let's get bloggy, even if I'm not sciencing the shit out of things myself. (Please note: Martian reference.)
