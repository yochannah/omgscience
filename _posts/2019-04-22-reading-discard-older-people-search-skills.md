## Reading list discard: Effect of training on biologist acceptance of tools

Shachak, A. and Fine, S. (2008), The Effect of training on biologists acceptance of bioinformatics tools: A field experiment. J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci., 59: 719-730. doi:10.1002/asi.20772

This article was mostly related to how biologists felt about certain bioinformatics tools after hands-on training workshops using two different training methods. The study was broadly about the training rather than about usability or mental models formed. The one slightly interesting note for me (and reason it probably turned up in my search) was this sentence, near the conclusion:

> It is suggested that the ability of experienced learners to form a mental model of the system is not dependent on the hands‚Äêon training method and hence this did not affect their perceptions of the bioinformatics tools.

Further investigations related to training (and especially lack of) for new biology related systems could be interesting - I should check out the citations of this article.
