title: Biological mental model study call for participants - wetlab edition

I'm still looking for a few final participants for my [mental models](/2019/07/29/call-for-participants.html) study. To recap on the previous recruitment notice, I'm running a study to learn about what differences there are (if any) between the way biologists think about biological data compared to programmers.

I've already interviewed quite a few software developers and bioinformaticians - now **I'm looking for pure wet lab biologists** with little or no programming experience, in the Cambridge area. (Sorry programmers! I love you but I have enough interviews from you already ❤️).

Interested in participating? A typical interview takes 30-60 minutes, and I can come to your site to interview you - all we need is a quiet-ish area to sit with a table.

## How you can help:

- Sign up to do an interview: email Yo Yehudi at yochannah.yehudi@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk for more info, or DM me on twitter if I follow you. I'm [@yoyehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi).
- Share [this poster ([pdf](/assets/AdvertisingPosterv3_nov_2019.pdf)] in your research institute, via email and/or noticeboards.
- Share word with others via Twitter.

## I want to know more!

The best way to learn more is to sign up to participate or to [watch my twitter account](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi); I'll release a preprint as soon as I reasonably feel I can, and I aim to do this by the end of the year. You can also read more about the study in the [participant information sheet](/assets/Participant Information And Consent Form.pdf) - apologies if it's a bit dry!

## Where / when?

I'm based at Cambridge, and right now I'm specifically looking for destinations in Cambridge where I can visit and perform 1-2 interviews onsite - wet lab participants only!
