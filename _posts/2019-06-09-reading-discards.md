Carole suggested that ontology design is similar to mental models. So far I think I'm looking in the wrong places though.

  - Why not useful? Mostly about methods to structure ontologies, less about eliciting them.

  - Why not useful? Very technical re datastorage, semantics, etc.

  - No human factors, again.

I think this is still a relevant places to explore, but maybe I need different search terms. "Eliciting" might be good.
