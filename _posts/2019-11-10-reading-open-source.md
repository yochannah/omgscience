[This paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222807#sec032) talks about sustainability of scientific software projects in the Earth Sciences - it's an interesting read and also useful to cite if you're ever writing about the need to _maintain_ software, not just race towards a paper/end of grant then forget about it. There's a set of recommendations at the end for individuals and for organisations.
