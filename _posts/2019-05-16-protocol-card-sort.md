##Â Protocol planning

Interviews:

1. Introduce participants and explain purpose of the research
2. Present user with consent form and explain what different levels of consent mean (e.g. consenting to data sharing in aggregate vs whole transcript of the recording being shared).
3. Background questionnaire will be conducted, by loading questionnaire on laptop and asking user to fill out.
4. Set up recording to record audio and/or video as per user's preference.
5. Explain task to participant: They will be offered a stack of cards with biological concepts on them, and we would like them to sort the cards in a way that makes sense to them. They will also be offered paper and pens, to allow them to sketch any relationships.
