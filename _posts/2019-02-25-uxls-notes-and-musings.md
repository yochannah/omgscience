Looking at the guides that they have - many are rather sparse but provide good reminders about possible directions to take and techniques to use.

- Personas is likely to be useful
- Prototype testing.
   - People we could target
      - Undergrads who know biology?
      - Grad students who know biology? <-- probably better.
      - people from the intermine community
        - who haven't we targeted before? :)


Task types that aren't likely to be useful right now:
- [card sorting](https://uxls.org/methods/card-sort/) - this might be useful for sorting report / list / templates pages, but not right now for the wizard.
