## 🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠

### Things to track

- sources of data useful to biologists and bioinformaticians
  - licence - this may need to have multiple questions, and potentially may change over time
  - attitudes and struggles
  - machine readability
- streams of information to glean from users.

### Things to do
- sign up to virtual biohackathon slack and group ☑️
- NF-core covid group ☑️
- RDA group
- ask (twitter?) for experiences
  - slight possibility of it being really difficult to manage responses.
  - possible mitigation?
      - Form? Pro - easy to submit, Con: possible duplications - but maybe good - more reported is more popular.
      - GitHub PR? Pro- less duplication and manual work on my side, Con, may not represent the strength / magnitude of the issues. May be a tech barrier. Many bioinformaticians would have the skill to do this or willingness to figure it out.

### Literature
- Look up literature regarding previous Ebola and Zika outbreaks - Nick Loman's data sharing stores.
- Other stuff. Become less vague about that this is 😆

### Questions to answer

In times of a pandemic when rapid response and data sharing is required,

#### Scope
- **In Scope:** biology and bioinformatics oriented data sources - genetic sequence data, protein data, viral strains, and statistical data relating to infections - infected, recovered, death, locations.
- biomedical / personal data?
  - **probably out of scope** no strongly personal data, such as mobile tracking app data. Don't disregard completely - there are concerns such as anonymising safely and state surveillance, securely gathering data.
