A list of articles that I've skimmed and decided are not useful; here's why.

---
Veretnik, Stella, J. Lynn Fink, and Philip E. Bourne. "Computational biology resources lack persistence and usability." PLoS computational biology 4.7 (2008).

## Why not useful?
Sure, usability is lacking. This is known. But there is too much focus on the lack of persistence, e.g. outdated databases that aren't maintained when grants run out. I care more about usability flaws - specifics - than the grant politics surrounding it. (Don't get me wrong, I care about grants a lot, but I'm not sure that this is the context I'm looking for.)
