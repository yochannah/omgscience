Note to self: never read an interesting paper and don't take notes. Never, never! I've been looking up the same papers over and over.... here are some of them:

- [Ten simple rules for delivering live distance training in bioinformatics across the globe using webinars](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007296) - a nice training paper with good guidelines for anticipating possible issues with remote training, e.g. bandwidth problems.
- [Ten simple rules for helping newcomers become contributors to open projects](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007296) - useful to justify the importance of community in open projects.
- [An empirical analysis of journal policy effectiveness for computational reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708290115) quote how often software and data aren't really available, despite journals requiring it.
- [Stop hiding your code](https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/04/18/stop-hiding-your-code/) blog post, references the article above.
