9 Month review is over and passed. Slides from my presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f3bwX-SUArcFU88XA3XhaN0ThwaMhZe_WVxZbo8Swxw/edit#slide=id.g621cf502c8_0_63

This was scary - I was incredibly nervous beforehand - and despite passing I felt like I hadn't really done all that well. My inner perfectionist being a jerk, I guess.
