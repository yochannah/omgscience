This paper is written by someone with experience of CLI bioinformatics tools, covering 10 guidelines for greater CLI usability. Whilst I think I'm typically concerned with UIs, this may also be relevant.

They cover providing useful feedback a well a general programming-relevant guidelines like not hardcoding, managing dependencies, etc.

Overall these are reasonable and decent guidelines but probably not something I'll refer to in the future.
