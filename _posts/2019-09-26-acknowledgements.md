People who I need to mention as various thanks in papers and eventually my thesis:

- Elsa, for helping me brainstorm the community intervention task.
- Gos, for adding the GitHub element to it
- Emmy and Naomi for always being there to talk
- Berenice and Malvika for bringing together Open Life Science
- All the people who helped me arrange interviews, especially: Robert Davey, Catherine, Pete, Laura Clark, Aidan Budd.
- Matus Kalas for sharing his thesis online and then walking me through the contents in-person later
- Bjorn for printing out my updated consent forms while he was in the middle of organising a massive conference.

This list is incomplete and will be added to whenever I can, but probably less often than it should be.
