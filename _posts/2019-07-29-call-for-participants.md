I'm conducting a study to see whether people from biological/wet-lab backgrounds vs more computational backgrounds tend to envision biological data structures differently. This involves in-person recorded interviews (30-60 minutes) so participants must be in the UK, although I am able to travel to meet you, so long as it's within a day trip from Cambridge (or several interviews at once at your institute). Weekends and evenings are fine for me too if that works for you.

How you can help:

- Sign up to do an interview: email Yo Yehudi at yochannah.yehudi@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk
- Share [this poster](assets/AdvertisingPoster.pdf) in your research institute, via email and/or noticeboards.
- Share word with others via Twitter.
