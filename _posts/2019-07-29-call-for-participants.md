title: Biological mental model study call for participants

**UPDATE, September 2019: I'm now hunting primarily for wet lab backgrounds or anyone with computational background but less than ten years experience in a biological domain!**

I'm conducting a study to see whether people from biological/wet-lab backgrounds vs more computational backgrounds tend to envision biological data structures differently. This involves in-person recorded interviews (30-60 minutes) so participants must be in the UK, although I am able to travel to meet you, so long as it's within a day trip from Cambridge (or several interviews at once at your institute). Weekends and evenings are fine for me too if that works for you.

## How you can help:

- Sign up to do an interview: email Yo Yehudi at yochannah.yehudi@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk for more info, or DM me on twitter if I follow you. I'm [@yoyehudi](https://twitter.com/yoyehudi).
- Share [this poster (docx)](/assets/AdvertisingPosterv2_sept_2019.docx) (Also available in [pdf](/assets/AdvertisingPosterv2_sept_2019.docx))  in your research institute, via email and/or noticeboards.
- Share word with others via Twitter. You can retweet [this tweet](https://twitter.com/i/timeline).

## I want to know more!

The best way to learn more is to sign up to participate or to [watch my twitter account]((https://twitter.com/yoyehudi); I'll release a preprint as soon as I reasonably feel I can, and I aim to do this by the end of the year. You can also read more about the study in the [participant information sheet](/assets/Participant Information And Consent Form.pdf) - apologies if it's a bit dry!

## Where / when?

I'm based at Cambridge, so anywhere that's a day trip or less I can come to easily - or you're welcome to come to me in Cambridge if you're nearby. I also have the following dates at specific sites planned (newer is on top).

- Sept 20 2019: e-Research Centre, Oxford. [Sign up here to participate](https://calendly.com/yo-yehudi-manchester/mental-model-study-oxford?month=2019-09&date=2019-09-20)
- August 28 2019: EBI, Hinxton [sign up now closed, thank you everyone who participated!]
- August 21 2019: Earlham Institute, Norfolk [sign up now closed, thank you everyone who participated!]
