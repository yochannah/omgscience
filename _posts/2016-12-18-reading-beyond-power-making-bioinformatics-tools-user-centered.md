title: Reading&#58; Beyond power&#58; making bioinformatics tools user-centered
---

This is an older paper, from 2004. It's still entirely relevant, however - it begins by pointing out just how important making usable bioinformatics tools is, alongside the fact that many people are unlikely to adopt tools with poor usability if they're used to richer interfaces elsewhere.

The researchers in this paper redesigned the NCBI website by aiming to adhere to known design patterns (Pattern Oriented Design), alongside a set of personas.

Why is this paper useful? Mostly as a backing reference saying we need to make bioinformatics more useable.
