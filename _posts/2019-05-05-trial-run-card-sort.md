Trial run of the card sort with a friend went better than expected.

- Sorted cards into piles of related items, correctly matching properties and property values to the right type. Later relationships were sketched on paper, related o a given pile of cards.
- Felt some attributes may have been missing, especially
  - Transcripts
  - Pathways
  - MRNA
  - Interactions
  - Expression
  - Regulatory Regions
  - Protein Function?

Cards to discard:

- Experiment
- attribute values that are just numbers. too vague. 
- Consider renaming database to dataset, or use both on the cards.
