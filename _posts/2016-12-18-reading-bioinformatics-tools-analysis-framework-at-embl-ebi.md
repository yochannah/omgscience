## Why not useful?

The paper itself is fine, but focuses on describing a suite of tools with a common interface, rather than any specific usability analysis. There were a few brief notes about user friendly interactivity - wizards, meaningful error messages, etc. but this was not the focus of the paper. 

The only other thing of any real note was that they had a UI and APIs, allowing both user friendly and programmatic access.
