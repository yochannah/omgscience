Mapping data models. I think I would like to [Preregister](https://cos.io/prereg/) this when we feel that the plan is as clear as possible.

## Research question:

Draft wording: Does a person's educational background in biology and computational subjects have an effect of their ability to create effective biological data models, and to map biological data onto this model?

## Background questionnaire

1. Educational background - biology (Do we want to get more specific than this?)
  - High School or lower
  - Undergraduate
  - Postgraduate or higher
2. Computer background (How can we make this more granular?)
 - Casual computer use (uses software as needed for work, prefers to be shown new things and/or have help troubleshooting)
 - I write some code or tweak code but don't consider myself to be a programmer. Excel spreadsheets, script tweaking, etc.
 - I write code on a regular basis.
2. Possibly a better approach than the previous Q: - check marks or scale for familiarity?
  a. Biology software: Are you familiar with any of the following?
    - Galaxy
    - BioMart
    - GeneCards
    - InterMine
    - Molgenis
    - (etc. // add more)
    - other (?)
  b. Computing languages (mix of common scripting languages + languages that teach users certain concepts, e.g. object oriented programming, graph DBs, SQL relationships)
    - R
    - Python
    - SQL
    - Perl
    - Java
    - Functional languages, e.g. Haskell, Clojure
    - Graph databases, e.g. Neo4J
    - Git or other version control
    - Other
3. What file formats do you work with, if any? (e.g. FASTA, GFF, BAM, VCF, etc...) (free form text)
4. Do you focus on any specific organisms? (free form text, too many to list!)

##Â Analysis of results...

// TBD
