Hi folks! I'm researching attitudes and challenges in COVID-19 related data access and data sharing, from a biology/bioinformatics research software engineer perspective.

My research question will explore:

> In times of a pandemic or epidemic when rapid response is required, what are attitudes towards pathogen-related data sharing and data access? In particular:

  - Are these data licenced in a way that permits re-use and redistribution?
  - Are they made available in ways that are easy to download and re-use, e.g. API or bulk download, machine-readable with relevant metadata?
  - What response do various communities have to these restrictions?

## Scope

Data types I am interested in: Data that have no strong ethical reasons to keep private, such as virus omics data and infection/death/recovery rates by geographic region.

Data that are out of scope: all private data that can not be shared easily, such as clinical personal data, including host omics data (e.g. human genomic data as opposed to virus sequence data), location data, and contact tracing.
