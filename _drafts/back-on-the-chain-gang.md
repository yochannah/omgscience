When in doubt, this is the place for me to go:

Collected (private) thoughts on what I know so far: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11tcWAOrrcKngTs3fS55h0tC2_qe-1Fpghy6YG0C_1iI/edit#heading=h.n3ae5zu4k30i

## List of things to do:

- read general usability papers about usability in complex applications
- read general usability papers about people dislike changing software and how it is handled.
- add papers to reading list
- read papers from the reading list
- read from various biology related sites - this can be a general free time activity too. Includes:
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/ Reddit biology
  - https://www.biostars.org/ Biostars even though the UI makes me uncomfortable
  - http://biology.stackexchange.com/ Biology.stackexchange. 'nuff said, can also favourite good questions. Focus on the bioinformatics tag?
  - re all above: I need to figure out a way to effectively filter the useful stuff from the less useful.

Could also:
- Find some nice bio data. Visualise it. Inspire from bivi, biojs.
- Investigate R's biology packages.
- make myself a little dictionary of terms.
