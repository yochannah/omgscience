In October I decided that rest was optional, and signed up to go to FORCE on Wednesday and Thursday (wearing my Manchester hat, and using my lieu days from GSoC summit), the GSoC mentor summit on Friday to Sunday (InterMine), and then ensure I had no breaks for weeks by going to MozFest from Thursday to Sunday. The conferences were all great - but taking no rest days for myself for three whole weeks? A pretty terrible decision. I ended up in a pretty terrible state by the weekend several weeks later when I finally had - gasp - a whole day to myself. Throughout these days I remember saying to Darren getting a cold would be nice because then I could have a break without taking any vacation days. Yikes.

The purpose of this blog as actually to reflect on the conferences, not just reflect on my terrible self-care. So.

## FORCE2019

This was the first time I'd been to FORCE, although I've been interested in it for a while, and I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure if I learned as much as I hoped or expected. My interest was specifically related to measuring science (I was thinking about software, but there's so much more in science and research to measure that I can learn from, potentially).

### Some highlights, in no particular order:

- Responsible metrics, Elizabeth Gadd. I enjoyed the talk, and some of the main take-aways from this for me were to choose relevant and suitable metrics - and not to just measure things that are easy but don't measure well, or to choose too few things to measure sensibly.
- Erika Pastrana Code publication and peer review: nice to hear about code ocean holding all the running code, but I worried that this setup could result in badly documented code, merely because the person who knows how to set it up also set up the code ocean instance too. They didn't seem to understand this concern when I raised it - if the reviewer doesn't test the deploy/running docs, they might not be correct or useful enough.
- I learned about registered reports. I didn't realise they were different from pre-registration.


###¬†Talks that stood out to me for the wrong reasons:
- The CZI talk about Meta, which has mystery paper quality algorithms and no intention of adding an ethical advisor to make sure they're not building bias right in to their "new, exciting" system.
- The Open Science MOOC talk. Jon Tennant claimed that the MOOC only took 4000 Euros to manage, and compared it to similar grant-funded infrastructures that cost millions. This was 1) disingenuous given that one was volunteer-led and one was not - they're not really comparable, and 2) _massively_ insulting to anyone who has ever volunteered to work on the MOOC, devaluing all the personal time they sacrificed, all of the employer wage if done on work time. It contrasted notably with Arfon Smith's talk about JOSS, where he carefully credited his editors and reviewers, and even estimated the time and cost taken if they were paid.

## GSoC Mentor Summit

I make a habit of reviewing my twitter analytics after conferences. GSoC isn't one of the really tweety ones, for a few reasons - one is simply that no hashtags are encouraged by Google, generally, but probably the main one is that as an unconference there tends to be a lot more hands-on talking and engagement, compared to a conference where there is just a string of talks which you may or may not be interested in.

Some of the special bits:

- A session led by Dalai from Blender, about growth. If a small organisation gets a sudden large infusion of cash, how would you scale? It's a problem every small organisation wants to have - but that doesn't make it less of a problem! I took notes at this session [here]() //ADD LINK
- A session about getting a better gender ratio in open source. One of my favourite lessons here - if a woman says something you agree with - just state "I agree". It seems obvious, but apparently helps the "woman says it, no-one listens, guy says the same thing, everyone listens" problem üòê.
