This blog is where my notes regarding bio usability will go, with the intent of having done a decent amount of reading and understanding in the bioinformatics usability area, so I can eventually work up the balls to apply for part-time postgrad study.

Initially this will mostly be reading papers and noting what seems to be useful and relevant.
