This blog is where my notes regarding bio usability and open source will go, with the intent of having done a decent amount of reading and understanding in the bioinformatics usability area, ~so I can eventually work up the nerve to apply for part-time postgrad study~

**Edit, Early 2019:** These pages are now notes _for_ my EngD ☺☺☺☺.

Initially this will mostly be reading papers and noting what seems to be useful and relevant.
