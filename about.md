Research log and reading notes for Yo Yehudi, an [EngD student at Manchester](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/yochannah.yehudi-postgrad.html).

The original purpose was to use this blog for notes regarding bio usability and open source, with the intent of having done a decent amount of reading and understanding in the bioinformatics usability area before applying for a part time PhD. In late 2018 I was accepted into the University of Manchester's [EngD program](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/programmes/list/11760/engd-software-systems-engineering/), as the first person doing this degree to my knowledge.

I write about my professional life sporadically at [yo-yehudi.com](http://yo-yehudi.com)
